          <h3>Economic Impact Analysis of Remote Work</h3>
          <p>
            In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the
            economic impacts of the shift to remote work during and after the
            COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from various sources including the
            Bureau of Labor Statistics and company surveys, I examined changes
            in productivity, real estate markets, and urban economics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key findings included a significant reduction in commercial real
            estate demand in urban centers, increased productivity in certain
            sectors, and a shift in consumer spending patterns. I used R for
            data analysis and visualization, creating compelling charts to
            illustrate these trends. This project enhanced my skills in data
            analysis, economic modeling, and policy evaluation.

          <h3>Econometric Analysis of Minimum Wage Effects</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, I performed an econometric analysis to study the
            effects of minimum wage increases on employment and income
            distribution. I collected panel data from 50 U.S. states over a
            20-year period, controlling for various economic factors such as GDP
            growth, inflation, and education levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using STATA, I applied fixed-effects regression models and
            difference-in-differences analysis. The results suggested that
            moderate minimum wage increases had minimal negative effects on
            employment while significantly reducing income inequality. This
            project deepened my understanding of labor economics and enhanced my
            skills in econometric analysis and statistical software use.

          <h3>Economic Feasibility of Renewable Energy Transition</h3>
          <p>
            In this capstone project, I evaluated the economic feasibility of a
            rapid transition to renewable energy sources in a mid-sized European
            country. I developed a comprehensive economic model that
            incorporated factors such as infrastructure costs, job market
            shifts, energy price projections, and environmental externalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Python, I created a Monte Carlo simulation to account for
            uncertainties in technological progress and policy changes. The
            analysis revealed that while the initial costs were significant, the
            long-term economic benefits outweighed them, especially when
            factoring in reduced healthcare costs and climate change mitigation.
            I presented these findings to a panel of professors and industry
            experts, defending my methodology and conclusions. This project
            showcased my ability to tackle complex economic problems, use
            advanced modeling techniques, and present findings effectively.
