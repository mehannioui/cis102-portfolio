          <h3>Stock Market Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the technology
            sector in the S&P 500. Using Python and financial APIs, I gathered
            historical data on stock prices, earnings reports, and market
            trends. I then applied various statistical methods to identify
            patterns and potential investment opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key findings included a correlation between certain tech companies'
            R&D spending and their stock performance, as well as the impact of
            global events on the sector's volatility. This project enhanced my
            skills in data analysis, Python programming, and financial modeling.

          <h3>Cryptocurrency Investment Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, I developed a comprehensive investment strategy
            for cryptocurrency portfolios. I researched the top 20
            cryptocurrencies by market cap, analyzing their historical
            performance, technology fundamentals, and adoption rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Excel, I created a risk assessment model that factored in
            market volatility, regulatory risks, and technological advancements.
            The final product was a dynamic portfolio allocation tool that
            adjusts investment recommendations based on an investor's risk
            tolerance and market conditions. This project deepened my
            understanding of alternative investments and risk management in the
            digital asset space.

          <h3>Tech Startup Valuation</h3>
          <p>
            In this capstone project, I performed a comprehensive valuation of a
            high-growth tech startup. Using financial statements and market
            data, I applied various valuation methods including Discounted Cash
            Flow (DCF), Comparable Company Analysis, and Precedent Transactions
            Analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created detailed financial models in Excel, forecasting the
            company's growth trajectory and potential market share. The project
            culminated in a presentation to a panel of professors and industry
            professionals, where I defended my valuation and recommendations.
            This experience honed my financial modeling skills and deepened my
            understanding of how investors value early-stage companies in the
            tech sector.
