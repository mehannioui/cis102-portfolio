          <h3>Campus Sustainability Initiative</h3>
          <p>
            In this investigative piece, I delved into UC Berkeley's efforts to
            become a zero-waste campus by 2025. Through interviews with
            administration officials, environmental experts, and student
            activists, I explored the challenges and successes of this ambitious
            initiative. The article, published in The Daily Californian, sparked
            important conversations about sustainability practices on campus and
            led to increased student involvement in green initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            My research involved analyzing years of waste management data,
            attending city council meetings, and even participating in a
            campus-wide waste audit. This project not only honed my data
            journalism skills but also deepened my understanding of
            environmental reporting and its impact on local communities.

          <h3>Voices of the Pandemic</h3>
          <p>
            During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I conceptualized and
            produced a podcast series titled "Voices of the Pandemic." This
            series featured intimate conversations with Berkeley residents from
            all walks of life, documenting their experiences, challenges, and
            moments of resilience during this unprecedented time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of ten episodes, I interviewed healthcare workers,
            small business owners, teachers, and students, weaving their stories
            into a powerful narrative about community strength and adaptability.
            The podcast not only provided a platform for unheard voices but also
            served as a historical record of our community's response to the
            global crisis. This project significantly improved my audio editing
            skills and taught me the art of storytelling through sound.
