        <p>
          Hello! I'm Sarah Johnson, a passionate journalist-in-training at UC
          Berkeley. My journey into the world of journalism began with a simple
          curiosity about the world around me and a desire to share important
          stories with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently in my junior year, I'm majoring in Media Studies with a
          minor in Political Science. This interdisciplinary approach allows me
          to explore the intersections of media, politics, and society, giving
          me a unique perspective on current events and social issues.
        </p>
        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
          My passion for journalism was ignited during my high school years when
          I joined the school newspaper. Since then, I've been constantly
          seeking opportunities to hone my craft. At UC Berkeley, I've been an
          active member of The Daily Californian, where I've covered everything
          from campus events to local politics.
        </p>
        <h3>Skills and Interests</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Investigative Reporting</li>
          <li>Feature Writing</li>
          <li>Multimedia Storytelling</li>
          <li>Data Journalism</li>
          <li>Podcast Production</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of my academic pursuits, I'm deeply involved in campus life. I
          serve as the Vice President of the Berkeley Journalism Association,
          where I organize workshops and networking events for aspiring
          journalists. I'm also a volunteer at Berkeley's community radio
          station, KALX, where I've had the opportunity to produce and host my
          own show focused on local issues and student life.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not chasing stories or editing articles, you can find me
          exploring the diverse neighborhoods of the Bay Area, camera in hand,
          always on the lookout for untold stories and unique perspectives.
