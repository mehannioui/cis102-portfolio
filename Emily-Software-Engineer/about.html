      <p>
        Hello! I'm Emily Zhang, a junior at Tech University majoring in Computer
        Science with a minor in Data Science. My passion for technology and
        problem-solving has driven me to explore various areas of software
        development and artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I've maintained a 3.8 GPA while actively
        participating in various coding competitions and hackathons. These
        experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but also taught
        me the value of teamwork and creative thinking in the tech industry.
      </p>

        class="activity-image" />
      <p>
        Outside of my coursework, I'm an active member of our university's
        Artificial Intelligence Club, where I currently serve as the Vice
        President. In this role, I've organized workshops, invited guest
        speakers from industry leaders, and mentored junior members in AI
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also passionate about giving back to the community. I volunteer as a
        coding instructor at our local community center, teaching basic
        programming concepts to middle and high school students. This experience
        has reinforced my belief in the importance of STEM education and has
        improved my communication and leadership skills.
      </p>
      <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>

        class="activity-image" />
      <p>
        When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me exploring the outdoors
        through hiking and photography. I'm also an avid reader of science
        fiction and enjoy participating in local book clubs. These diverse
        interests help me maintain a well-rounded perspective and often inspire
        creative solutions in my technical work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm excited about the future of technology and my role in shaping it. If
        you'd like to connect or learn more about my experiences, feel free to
        reach out through my social media links or email!
